# Delay-Induced Congestion

In this repository we provide all code necessary to reproduce the results of the article "Obscuring digital route-choice information prevents delay-induced congestion" (V.Krall, M.Burg et al., https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11790). 

Follow the instructions in the Jupyter Notebook *GenerateResults.ipynb* to regenerate the figures and data. If you are interested in the implementation of the simulations, refer to the python files that are used in this notebook.

Additionally, the Mathematica Notebooks *Figures2_and_3.nb* and *Appendix_Figures* provide you with a step-by-step instruction for the analysis regarding the minimal route-choice model with delay introduced in the article. 

In the *data* folder, all data underlying the figures in the article is provided.
